# (@WeRateDogs Twitter Data)

## by (Ireyemi Stephen)



## Dataset
The @WeRateDogs twitter account posts images of dogs as well as rate them and comment about them. Following the wrangling of data in my wrangle_report, I analyzed the datasets of 2356 **WeRateDogs tweets** and 2,075 **image predictions**, 2354 **tweet data** , and after combining I had 1994 data entries expect that of dog_stage .


## Act summary

There are 5 major steps I carried out to wrangle (analyze and visualize) the data. These steps are: Data Gathering, Assessing, Cleaning, Storing and Analyzing & visualizing.

My analysis sought to know the following:

1. Exploration of data description.

2. What is the strenght or nature of relationships between the retweets, favorites and dog predictions p1-p3?

3. Dog-stage ratio(what is the most popular stage and least popular stage?)

4. What is the success rate of the algorithm predictions?



## Summary of Findings

The summary of my findings are:

1. From the data exploration analysis, it is noted that most tweets are liked than retweeted as retweet count has a lower average than favorite count.

2. There is a postive correlation between retweet count and favorite count feature.

3. In the dog-ratio analysis, Pupper the most numbered stage and Floofer the least number stage.

4. It is observed that the three predictions have relatively close algorithm success-rate with p2_dog predicton is the most successful.
